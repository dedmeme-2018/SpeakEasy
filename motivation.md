# Motivations for Development

With the recent Facebook controversy regarding the distribution of usersâ€™ private data, it became clear that privacy was a huge concern for many customers. SpeakEasy will be designed with privacy as its primary differentiator from other Social Networks. 

We plan to include various UI elements and features that will give users a sense of security and control over their personal data. Additionally, the backend will be encrypted to ensure user data is only shared when they allow it. 

We hope that by focusing on frontend and presenting a well designed UI, users will feel more secure and trust their data is safe on SpeakEasy.
