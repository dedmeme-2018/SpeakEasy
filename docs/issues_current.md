# Current Issues (Updated 6/14/18)

These are issues that we are currently attempting to address.

## MySQL to Firebase Conversion
The Vue Mini Social Network we use has MySQL as the backend. We want to eventually migrate over to Firebase and have provided the necessary documentation for a future team to do so. 

## Testing
We encountered problems with getting tests to work throughout our project, but we kept pushing the issue back. Now that it is the end of the project, we are still unable to get tests to work so we should have definitely addressed this sooner.

## Mobile Support
We knew Peter wanted the MVP to work on a variety of devices, however, we also delayed addressing mobile device support and were unable to finish this feature. We should have begun by directly addressing the features Peter requested before working on other features. 

## Component Documentation
We were working on getting all our components documented. Multiple documentation generation tools did not work, so we resorted to manual documentation. This was a sort of late decision as well since we wanted to have more comprehensive docs.
