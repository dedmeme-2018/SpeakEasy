# Past Issues (Updated 6/15/18)

These are problems that we have encountered in our development process and learned from.

## Front-end Framework Choice

### Vue vs React
Initially, we chose **Vue** as our framework due to the perceived smaller learning curve and lightweight nature. However, we discovered there were very few social media libraries available for us to build upon. The ones we did find did not have firebase support so we backed off and tried **React**. 

We attempted for a week to build upon **React Social Network** but it was not well documented or suited to development. We made the tricky decision to cut our losses and again go to **Vue**. As we switched our project back to Vue, we learned that our initial impressions were true. We have thus been able to make much quicker progress working with Vue. 

## Testing
We encountered problems with getting tests to work throughout our project, but we kept pushing the issue back. Now that it is the end of the project, we are still unable to get tests to work so we should have definitely addressed this sooner.

## Mobile Support
We knew Peter wanted the MVP to work on a variety of devices, however, we also delayed addressing mobile device support and were unable to finish this feature. We should have begun by directly addressing the features Peter requested before working on other features. 

## Component Documentation
We were working on getting all our components documented. Multiple documentation generation tools did not work, so we resorted to manual documentation. This was a sort of late decision as well since we wanted to have more comprehensive docs.
