These are problems that we have encountered in our development process and have resolved to a reasonable degree. 

## Front-end Framework Choice

### Vue vs React
Initially, we chose **Vue** as our framework due to the perceived smaller learning curve and lightweight nature. However, we discovered there were very few social media libraries available for us to build upon. The ones we did find did not have firebase support so we backed off and tried **React**. We attempted for a week to build upon **React Social Network** but it was not well documented or suited to development. We made the tricky decision to cut our losses and again go to **Vue**. As we switched our project back to Vue, we learned that our initial impressions were true. We have thus been able to make much quicker progress working with Vue.
