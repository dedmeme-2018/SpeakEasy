# Past Issues (Updated 6/14/18)

These are problems that we have encountered in our development process and have resolved to a reasonable degree. 

## Front-end Framework Choice
### Vue
Initially, we chose Vue as our framework due to the perceived smaller learning curve and lightweight nature. As we switched our project back to Vue, we learned that our initial impressions were true. We have thus been able to make much quicker progress working with Vue. 

### React
We attempted to switch our framework to React prior to this. This decision was made due to the lack of social network libraries for Vue. We learned that the popularity of a framework was much more important than anticipated. React's popularity is evident from the more abundant third-party libraries and tools available. However, the React Social Network we were working with was not well documented and very difficult to build upon.
