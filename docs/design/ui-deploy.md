# UI

Our goal is to convey a sense of security through look and feel, not just features. We believe minimal and clean UI provides the best user experience and our design reflects that. 

Here are the deployed iterations of our UI. 

### Landing Page
As the first impression of our site, the landing page is essential. Our pitch is clearly laid out and users can get a quick gist of what SpeakEasy has to offer.
