# UI

We want to focus heavily on the UI for this project. Our goal is to convey a sense of security through look and feel, not just features.

Here are some conceptual mock-ups of UI elements that we believe represent our vision:

### Landing Page
We decided that something like this huge Lock was a little too imposing for a social network, but we could tone it down and make something similar for the MVP.

### Login Animation
Simple animations like these add subtle feelings of privacy and security.

### Minimal Design
A minimal design contrasts the annoying and intrusive posts and ads you see on Facebook.

### Post Animation
Again, animations like these add important security cues to the product.

### Personal Data Page
The page where users could see all their data would be easily accessible. We discussed altering this design to be more distinct from the typical feed to convey a greater sense of permanence when deleting data.
