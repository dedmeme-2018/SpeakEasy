# Keen UI
We are using a Vue.js UI library called [Keen UI](https://github.com/JosephusPaye/Keen-UI). It is a lightweight collection of essential UI components written with Vue and inspired by Material Design.

# Development Usage:

1. Every Keen-UI component has been registered to the view app as is seen in the main.js file
1. In order to use Keen-UI components in any Vue component’s template, refer to the Keen-UI docs for source code examples.

1. You can copy the TEMPLATE code from the source code examples and alter them as needed
1. BE SURE to check the bottom of the source code example file for any methods, properties, etc. that the component needs in order to run.
	- You must include these in the default export section of the Vue component that uses the Keen-UI component.
1. Might sound complicated but it’s really simple!
